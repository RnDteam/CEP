If we don't want to update fields of the person, but only emit an alert, would prefer that this person in the agent.adsc the collaborator, othewise the suspect.

when a dwelling with criminal report occurs 
definitions 
	set 'nearby distance' to the nearby distance in meters of this dwelling with criminal report ;

if the number of 'too late encounters' is 0

then 

set the alert message of 'the person' to "Suspect person " + the id of 'the suspect' + " has been with criminal " + the id of 'the collaborator';
